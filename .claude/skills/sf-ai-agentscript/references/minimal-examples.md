# Minimal Working Examples

## Hello-World Agent Script

A complete, deployable agent with one topic, one action, and conditional logic:

```yaml
config:
  developer_name: "simple_agent"
  agent_description: "A minimal working agent example"
  agent_type: "AgentforceServiceAgent"
  default_agent_user: "agent_user@yourorg.com"

system:
  messages:
    welcome: "Hello! How can I help you today?"
    error: "Sorry, something went wrong."
  instructions: "You are a helpful customer service agent."

variables:
  customer_verified: mutable boolean = False

topic main:
  description: "Main conversation handler"
  reasoning:
    instructions: ->
      if @variables.customer_verified == True:
        | You are speaking with a verified customer.
        | Help them with their request.
      else:
        | Please verify the customer's identity first.
    actions:
      verify: @actions.verify_customer
        description: "Verify customer identity"
        set @variables.customer_verified = @outputs.verified

start_agent entry:
  description: "Entry point for all conversations"
  reasoning:
    instructions: |
      Greet the customer and route to the main topic.
    actions:
      go_main: @utils.transition to @topic.main
        description: "Navigate to main conversation"
```

### Key Points

- **`config` block**: `developer_name` must match the folder name (case-sensitive)
- **`default_agent_user`**: Must be a valid Einstein Agent User in the target org — query with `sf data query`
- **`instructions: ->`**: Procedural mode enables `if`/`else` and `run` directives
- **`instructions: |`**: Literal mode for static text passed to the LLM
- **`set @variables.X = @outputs.Y`**: Captures action output into mutable state
- **`@utils.transition`**: Permanent handoff (does not return to calling topic)
